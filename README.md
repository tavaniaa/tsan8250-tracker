# PageNibbles Documentation

## Introduction
With millions of books being published each year, it’s hard to keep track of which ones you have read and which ones you haven’t. PageNibbles, is a web application that can assist you with memorialising the troublesome number of titles stored up in your brain, tracking your immaculate taste in books.

Users will be able to enter their book details in under a minute, view the titles and curated statistics of their digital library, then return to what they enjoy most: reading.

With a simple, modern and user-friendly format, PageNibbles will be great for young bookworms who aesthetics combined with easy-to-use functionality. The app hopes to reduce the time readers spend on their screens in order to make more time for them to spend with their heads in their books.

Browser: Google Chrome

## Iterations
1. Removed delete confirmation due to limited time constraints and more complicated functionality
2. Removed Insights button and popup due to it being an unnecessary feature
3. Added media query for a responsive mobile design and was working, however it started zooming in after an iteration.

## Future improvements
With more time, improvements can be made to the PageNibbles web app:
1. Add delete confirmation
2. Add Insights feature back into the design
3. Improve and fix media query
3. Optimize code
